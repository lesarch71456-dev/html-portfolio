<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Charles Cruz, I help businesses turn leads into booked calls, conversations, and sales—using smart systems, 
  clean design, and automation that actually makes sense.</p>

<p>I specialize in GoHighLevel (GHL), where I build high-converting funnels, organized CRM pipelines, and automated
   workflows that save time and remove manual follow-ups. My focus is not just making things look good, but making sure
    every page, form, and automation has a clear purpose: conversion.</p>

<p>I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, scalable systems. Whether it is a real estate funnel, a financial advisor
   lead magnet, or a service-based booking flow, I design with both the business owner and the end user in mind.</p>
